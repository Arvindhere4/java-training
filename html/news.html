    <pre> | The Amar Jawan Jyoti flame has been burning for more than five decades <br>
<strong>eternal flame at a war memorial in the Indian capital, Delhi, has been put out and merged with a newer flame.</strong>

The Amar Jawan Jyoti, which has been burning for more than five decades to honour the martyrs of the armed forces, was merged on Friday with a newer flame located less than 400m away in the newly built National War Memorial.

Both are located in the India Gate complex, which was inaugurated in 1931 in memory of Indian soldiers who died fighting for the British Raj.

The Amar Jawan Jyoti inspired generations of Indians and became an iconic image. Television coverage of India's Republic Day parades always started with visuals of the flame.

The flame at the National War Memorial, which was inaugurated in 2019, would now serve as a memorial for all martyrs of the armed forces. It has names of the soldiers who died in wars and conflicts after India became independent in 1947.

Lieutenant General Vinod Bhatia, who spent many years in Delhi in senior military roles, recounts his memories of the Amar Jawan Jyoti and what it meant to him and millions of Indians. His account is accompanied by pictures by Aditya Kapoor, who was given exclusive access in 2009 to photograph the iconic India Gate complex.

When the Amar Jawan Jyoti was established, I was studying at the National Defence Academy to become an officer. So, I didn't know much about it at the time. But after getting commissioned, I came to Delhi and then I went to see the flame in October 1974.
